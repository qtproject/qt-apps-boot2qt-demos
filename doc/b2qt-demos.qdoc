    \title Qt 5.9.8 for Device Creation Examples and Demos

    \SDK has a number of examples and demos. These are included in the
    \B2Q images, available in the launcher that is run by default at
    startup.

    In Qt Creator, you can find and open them from \b Welcome > \b Examples
    by selecting a \c {Boot2Qt} version of Qt from the drop-down list.

    \brief Demonstrates using camera in a QML application.

    \image b2qt-demo-camera.jpg

    This example demonstrates the use of the camera features provided by Qt Multimedia with
    Qt Quick.

    Demo can be used to take pictures. Files are saved inside the \c {/data/images/} folder
    and can be then viewed with the \l {Photo Gallery} demo application.

    Camera parameters such as flash mode, scene mode or white balance can be changed. The
    availability of parameters depends on what the camera driver provides.

    \image b2qt-demo-graphicaleffects.jpg

    This example shows the Qt Quick 2.0 ShaderEffect type and the Qt Graphical Effects module. Qt Quick
    2.0 provides the ability to use inline GLSL in your Qt Quick applications to create stunning visual
    effects. However, as UIs typically reuse many of the same effects, the Qt Graphical Effects module
    provides a set of predefined, commonly used effects. This includes blur, drop-shadows, glow,
    blending, opacity masks and more.

    \image b2qt-demo-canvas3d-planets.jpg

    The demo uses Qt Quick and Canvas 3D in combination with \l{http://threejs.org/}{three.js},
    \l{https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.planets}{threex.planets}, and Qt Quick
    Controls. Tapping on a planet changes the view and moves to the chosen planet. Use the sliders
    to adjust the zoom levels and viewing distance. Tapping outside the controls moves the focus
    back to the solar view.

    The Qt5 Cinematic Experience is a demo by "QUIt Coding", a small group of talented individuals
    enjoying software development with cutting edge technologies. They are official members of the
    Qt Ambassador Program.

    The demo shows off a number features of Qt Quick 2.0. A nicely styled list control of movie
