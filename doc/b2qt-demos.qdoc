    \title Qt 5.12.8 for Device Creation Examples and Demos

    \SDK has a number of examples and demos. These are included in the
    \B2Q images, available in the launcher that is run by default at
    startup.

    In Qt Creator, you can find and open them from \b Welcome > \b Examples
    by selecting a \c {Boot2Qt} version of Qt from the drop-down list.

    \title e-bike Demo
    \ingroup b2qt-demos
    \brief An E-bike instrument cluster concept.

    \image b2qt-demo-ebike-ui.jpg

    An E-bike instrument cluster concept designed and implemented by Qt.

    The entire concept is a testament that Qt brings the HMI designers and Software engineers together
    by using the same tools, allowing them to fast prototyping through collaborative workflow.
    In addition to that, Qt is optimized for running on low end SoC even the ones that don't have GPU acceleration
    for graphics.

    \example basicsuite/graphicaleffects
    \title Graphical Effects
    \ingroup b2qt-demos
    \brief Demonstrates the different graphical effects that can be used in a QML application.

    \image b2qt-demo-graphicaleffects.jpg

    This example shows the Qt Quick 2.0 ShaderEffect type and the Qt Graphical Effects module. Qt Quick
    2.0 provides the ability to use inline GLSL in your Qt Quick applications to create stunning visual
    effects. However, as UIs typically reuse many of the same effects, the Qt Graphical Effects module
    provides a set of predefined, commonly used effects. This includes blur, drop-shadows, glow,
    blending, opacity masks and more.

    \title Media Player
    \ingroup b2qt-demos
    \brief A media player implemented in QML.

    \image b2qt-demo-mediaplayer.jpg
    The Media Player example demonstrates the use of the media playback features of Qt Multimedia with
    Qt Quick.

    It can play from a file or from a network source, both videos and music.

    \title Text Input
    \ingroup b2qt-demos
    \brief Demonstrates text input capabilities and the virtual keyboard in a QML application.

    \image b2qt-demo-textinput.jpg

    This example illustrates how to handle input on touch devices.

    The Boot to Qt stack comes with Qt Virtual Keyboard - a framework that consists of a C++ back
    end with support for custom input methods, as well as a reference keyboard front end
    implemented in QML, supporting multiple languages.

    \brief Showcases the different types of charts available from the Qt Charts library.

    \image b2qt-demo-enterprise-charts.jpg

    Qt Charts is part of the Qt Enterprise addons package which provides a set of easy to use
    chart components. This demo showcases the different charts that are available as QML types.

    \brief  A gallery of controls.

    \image b2qt-demo-qtquickcontrols2.jpg

    The gallery example is a simple application with a drawer menu that contains all the Qt Quick Controls 2. Each
    menu item opens a page that shows the graphical appearance of a control, allows you to interact with the control,
    and explains in which circumstances it is handy to use this control.

    The example can be used to browse the internet (working network connection
    required).
