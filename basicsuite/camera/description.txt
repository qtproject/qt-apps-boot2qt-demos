This example demonstrates the use of the camera features of Qt Multimedia with Qt Quick.

Demo can be used to take photos which are saved in the /data/images/ directory. Camera parameters such as flash mode, scene mode or white balance can be changed. The availability of parameters depends on what the camera driver provides.
